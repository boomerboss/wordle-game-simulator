# wordle-game-simulator
### Purpose:
Simulate each possible game of Wordle using a specific guess to evaluate its average effectiveness
### Method:
For each game (each possible answer) it simulates the colors that the guess would generate, then goes through all of the answers to eliminate ones that
are no longer possible with those colors. Saves the amount eliminated as a "score." This score can be accessed individually or by averaging every score to get the
guess' average effectiveness.
